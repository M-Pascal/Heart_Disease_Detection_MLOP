# Machine Learning Pipeline Summative (MLOP).

# Heart Disease Diagnosis Project

## Project overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease, a leading global cause of disability and death. Heart disease encompasses various conditions affecting the heart and circulatory system, often leading to severe complications like heart attacks and organ damage.
Early detection of heart disease can save lives by enabling timely intervention. A predictive model helps identify high-risk individuals, supports medical decision-making, and improves preventive careâ€”reducing healthcare costs and improving patient outcomes.
